# 2. Append Sum
# Let’s create a function that calculates the sum of the last two elements of a list and appends it to the end. After doing so, it will repeat this process two more times and return the resulting list. You can choose to use a loop or manually use three lines. Here are the steps we need:

# Define the function to accept one parameter for our list of numbers
# Add the last and second to last elements from our list together
# Append the calculated value to the end of our list.
# Repeat steps 2 and 3 two more times
# Return the modified list
# Write a function named append_sum that has one parameter — a list named named lst.

# The function should add the last two elements of lst together and append the result to lst. It should do this process three times and then return lst.

# For example, if lst started as [1, 1, 2], the final result should be [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].

# Use the below code snippet to start the problem:

# #Write your function here


# #Uncomment the line below when your function is done
# #print(append_sum([1, 1, 2]))
